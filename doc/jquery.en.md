# JQuery

Plgapp is hosting JQuery versions 1.11.3 and 2.1.3. If you want to use it
in your application please add following elements into your html page:

```html
<head>
  <!-- Compiled and minified JavaScript for JQuery 1.11.3 -->
  <script src="/plgapp/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>

  <!-- Compiled and minified JavaScript for JQuery 2.1.3 -->
  <script src="/plgapp/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
</head>
```

## Why plgapp hosts own jquery?
